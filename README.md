# Oath

  Great thinkers throughout the ages claim that to change the world you must first change yourself. Oath helps us do   both at once.
  
  First, using a quantified self device, set a personal goal, such as a step or sleep goal.
  
  Then, to help you hit your goal, up the ante by paying for a social benefit from our menu, such as having a tree     planted or a vaccine sponsored.
  
  Track your progress from the Oath dashboard. If you suceed in achieving your goal, your donation goes through.
  
  Oath makes explicit the notion that our personal change also changes the world. It helps us achieve the goals we     set out to accomplish.
  
  Improve yourself. Improve the world.
